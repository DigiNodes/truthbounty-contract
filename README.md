## 🌍 Overview

This repository contains the **smart contracts** that power TruthBounty’s decentralized verification and incentive mechanisms.

The contracts handle:
- Verifier staking
- Reward distribution
- Reputation-weighted participation
- Transparent, auditable verification outcomes

TruthBounty contracts are designed as **public-good primitives**, enabling trust-minimized fact verification at scale.

---

## 🌱 Ecosystem Alignment

TruthBounty contracts are aligned with:

- **Ethereum** – secure, neutral settlement layer  
- **Optimism** – low-cost reward distribution  
- **Stellar (planned)** – micro-rewards & global accessibility  
- **Public Goods Funding** – long-term sustainability via Drips  

Contracts are intentionally modular to support **multi-chain deployments**.

## 🔗 Contract Responsibilities

### Core Modules

- **Verifier Staking**
  - Users stake tokens to participate in verification
  - Stake size influences verification weight

- **Reward Distribution**
  - ERC-20 rewards issued based on consensus outcomes
  - Slashing for malicious or incorrect verification

- **Reputation Hooks**
  - Reputation updates triggered by verification results
  - Designed to integrate with off-chain scoring engines

---

## 🌟 Stellar Compatibility (Planned)

TruthBounty smart contracts are designed with **Soroban compatibility** in mind.

### Planned Integrations
- Soroban-based reward settlement
- Stellar-native verifier incentives
- Cross-chain verification proofs (Ethereum ↔ Stellar)
- Low-fee micro-rewards for emerging markets

TruthBounty treats smart contracts as **portable logic**, not ecosystem lock-in.

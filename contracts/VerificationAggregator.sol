/**
 * @title VerificationAggregator
 * @notice Deterministic weighted consensus engine for TruthBounty V2.

 * Reads the frozen effectiveStake values recorded by TruthBountyWeighted at
 * vote time and folds them into trueWeight / falseWeight totals. The result
 * is stored on-chain so every downstream module — settlement, reputation,
 * slashing, disputes — reads the same canonical outcome.
 *
 * Design principles
 * -----------------
 * - Pure integer arithmetic. No floats, no division before multiplication.
 * - Order-independent iteration. The outcome is the same regardless of the
 *   order verifiers appear in claimVoters[].
 * - Extensible weighting. The current formula is weight = effectiveStake
 *   (already incorporates reputation via TruthBountyWeighted). Future
 *   versions can add quadratic / committee / zk multipliers by overriding
 *   the IVerificationSource interface without storage layout changes.
 * - Separation of concerns. This contract only computes consensus; it never
 *   transfers funds, slashes stakes, or modifies claim state.
